# üî¥ 2D Canvas Shooter

## üìñ Description

_Survive and destroy as many circles as you can! The more you play, the harder it gets! Do you have the "balls" to do it?_

After learning so much HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the idea to create a little game came into mind. I grew up playing flash games, especially top down shooters like SAS: Zombie Assault and Decision. My idea was to create something simple but from scratch to practice what I've learned so far. I took some ideas from one of the Chris Course's videos because I enjoyed his project a lot (and learned so much from it). I would like to move to a proper game engine or framework like Godot or Phaser in the near future.

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

- `WASD` - Move character (white ball)
- `Left mouse` - Shoot projectiles

## üéØ Objectives with its Development

- Create a game with pure JavaScript using **Canvas API**;
- Practice with ES6 **classes** and **modules**;
- Learn some **game design** concepts.

## üìé Learning Resources

These resources helped me understand many things regarding game development in JavaScript and the Mathematical logic. Not everything was applied in the project, but they are still great study material to me. Feel free to look around.
