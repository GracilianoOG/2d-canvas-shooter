# üî¥ 2D Canvas Shooter

## üìñ Description

After learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the idea to create a little game came into mind. I grew up playing flash games, especially top down shooters like SAS: Zombie Assault and Decision. My idea was to create something simple but from scratch to practice what I've learned so far. I took some ideas from one of the Chris Course's videos because I enjoyed his project a lot (and learned so much from it). I would like to move to a proper game engine or framework like Godot or Phaser in the near future.

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

- `WASD` - Move character (white ball)
- `Left mouse` - Shoot projectiles

## üéØ Objectives with its Development

- Create a game with pure JavaScript using **Canvas API**;
- Practice with ES6 **classes** and **modules**;
- Learn some **game design** concepts.
