# üî¥ Circle Chaos

## üìñ Description

_The player takes control of a little white ball that must survive against the infinite waves of colorful circles of many different colors and sizes._

After learning enough about web development, the idea to create a little game came to mind. I grew up playing flash games, especially top-down shooters like SAS: Zombie Assault and Decision. My idea was to create something simple, but from scratch, to practice what I've learned so far. Some ideas were taken from one of Chris Course's videos because they were so creative!

I learned a lot of JavaScript, Canvas API, and Game Design concepts while developing this little game. I also committed many mistakes that taught me what not to do in future projects. I would like to move to a proper game engine or framework like Godot or Phaser in the near future, but I'd still create more games in vanilla JS, just for fun.

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

- Move character with `<WASD>` or `<ARROWS>`
- Hold `<LMB>` to shoot
- Press `<P>` to pause

## üß± Built with

- HTML and CSS for the UI, menus, and canvas;
- Canvas API and JavaScript for game logic and input handling;
- [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) for audio management (SFX and music);
- [Vite.js](https://vite.dev/) as the build tool.

## üéØ Run locally

These resources helped me to understand many things regarding game development in JavaScript and the mathematical logic behind it. Not everything was applied to the project, but they are still great study material for me.
